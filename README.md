# Troyonix Protocol

**Troyonix Protocol** is the blockchain foundation of Troyonix, designed to tokenize and manage real-world and digital assets in a secure, compliant, and scalable way.  

---

## 🔑 Focus Areas
- **Smart Contracts** → ERC-20 / ERC-721 / ERC-1155 for asset tokenization  
- **Compliance Hooks** → KYC/AML checks, permissioned transfers  
- **Backend API** → FastAPI service to interact with contracts and databases  
- **Developer Layer** → Clean abstractions so firms can issue, manage, and trade tokenized assets easily  

The protocol is the **infrastructure layer** that the main **Troyonix AI Platform** will build on.

## 🛠️ Engineering Roadmap

### 1. Contracts
- Start with ERC-20 token contract (fractional ownership)  
- Extend to ERC-721 / 1155 for unique or hybrid assets  
- Add compliance modules (whitelisted addresses, transfer restrictions)  

### 2. Backend
- FastAPI service:
  - `/mint` → Issue tokenized assets  
  - `/transfer` → Move tokens between verified parties  
  - `/balance` → Fetch holdings  
- Database: Supabase for user/asset registry  

### 3. Testing
- Use **Hardhat** (or **Foundry**) for contract testing  
- Write integration tests for backend ↔ contract workflows  

### 4. Deployment
- Deploy contracts → Testnet (Polygon, Ethereum Sepolia)  
- Run backend → Docker + Railway/Fly.io for quick spin-up

## 🔗 How This Fits Into Troyonix
- **Troyonix Protocol** = The **tokenization engine** (on-chain)  
- **Troyonix AI Platform** = The **intelligence & user layer** (off-chain: AI agents, portfolio insights, client engagement)  

👉 Together → a complete tokenized wealth system, where the **protocol is the foundation** and the **AI layer is the brain**.

## 🌍 The Vision
If we split the Troyonix vision cleanly:  

- **Troyonix Protocol** = the plumbing layer → smart contracts, token standards, compliance, APIs.  
  *This is your “settlement + issuance” engine. Think of it like the rails Visa/Mastercard run on.*  

- **Troyonix AI Platform** = the intelligence + experience layer → agents, dashboards, portfolio optimization, risk models, compliance AI.  
  *This is the “Visa network + fraud detection + customer portal” on top.*  

✨ Together → you’re not just making another DeFi protocol. Your building knew financial systems.
- Instead of just moving dollars → moving tokenized real assets (funds, equities, real estate, alt investments)  
- Instead of slow TradFi rails → instant, cross-chain rails  
- Instead of just settlement → AI-driven compliance + intelligence (where Visa/MC don’t touch)  

**Troyonix**
The protocol does the **raw settlement**, the AI layer does the **oversight and insight**, and together they form a **global tokenized finance operating system**.

## ⚡ Tokenization Setup / Purpose
- The **TCP/IP moment for finance**  
- Finance has always been gatekept  
- It’s time to innovate and change that  
- Instead of money and assets being stuck in walled systems (banks, brokers, blockchains), everything becomes **liquid, fast, global, and open**  
- Tokenize Troyonix: **Name it Troy**

## 📝 First Step
- Set up correct programming languages + frameworks to build the Troyonix blockchain layer  
- Mission: deliver the **first smart contracts** powering the Troyonix Protocol
