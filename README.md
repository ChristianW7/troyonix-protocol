Troyonix Protocol 

Troyonix Protocol is the blockchain foundation of Troyonix, designed to tokenize and manage real-world and digital assets in a secure, compliant, and scalable way.

This repo focuses on:
-Smart Contracts → ERC-20/ERC-721/ERC-1155 for asset tokenization.
-Compliance Hooks → KYC/AML checks, permissioned transfers.
-Backend API → FastAPI service to interact with contracts and databases.
-Developer Layer → Clean abstractions so firms can issue, manage, and trade tokenized assets easily.

The protocol is the infrastructure layer that the main Troyonix AI platform will build on.

Engineering Roadmap

1. Contracts
	•	Start with ERC-20 token contract (fractional ownership).
	•	Extend to ERC-721/1155 for unique or hybrid assets.
	•	Add compliance modules (whitelisted addresses, transfer restrictions).

2. Backend
	•	FastAPI service:
	•	/mint → Issue tokenized assets.
	•	/transfer → Move tokens between verified parties.
	•	/balance → Fetch holdings.
	•	Database → Supabase for user/asset registry.

3. Testing
	•	Use Hardhat (or Foundry) for contract testing.
	•	Write integration tests for backend ↔ contract workflows.

4. Deployment
	•	Deploy contracts → Testnet (Polygon, Ethereum Sepolia).
	•	Run backend → Docker + Railway/Fly.io for quick spin-up.

How This Fits Into Troyonix
	•	Troyonix Protocol = The tokenization engine (on-chain).
	•	Troyonix AI Platform = The intelligence & user layer (off-chain, AI agents, portfolio insights, client engagement).
	•	Together → A complete tokenized wealth system, where the protocol is the foundation and the AI layer is the brain.


If we split the Troyonix vision cleanly:
-Troyonix Protocol = the plumbing layer → smart contracts, token standards, compliance, APIs. This is your “settlement + issuance” engine. Think of it like the rails Visa/Mastercard run on.
-Troyonix AI Platform = the intelligence + experience layer → agents, dashboards, portfolio optimization, risk models, compliance AI. This is the “Visa network + fraud detection + customer portal” on top.

Together → you’re not just making another DeFi protocol. You’re building the equivalent of Visa for DeFi, but future-proofed:
-Instead of just moving dollars, you’re moving tokenized real assets (funds, equities, real estate, alt investments).
-Instead of slow TradFi rails, you’ve got instant, cross-chain rails.
-Instead of just settlement, you’re bundling in AI-driven compliance + intelligence, which is where Visa/MC don’t touch.

So yes — Troyonix = Visa for DeFi, but smarter. The protocol does the raw settlement, the AI layer does the oversight and insight, and together they make a global tokenized finance operating system.


# Tokenization Setup / Overall purpose
- The TCP/IP moment for finance 
- Finance has always been gatekept
- Its time to innovate and change that
- Instead of money and assets being stuck in walled systems, (banks, brokers, blockchains) everything becomes liquid, fast global, and open.
- Tokenize Troyonix: Name it Troy 

Step 1:
-Setup correct programming languages so we can create our own blockchain.
-Mission is to have a smart contract when it comes to the troyonix protocol
